Development process

Learnt how to use ES6 and ES7 by reading Typescript documentation. I had only used ES5.

Learnt about basics of Phaser and game development from https://phaser.io/ and Gamefromscratch : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8a8-SO6vP0&t=1862s
I did not know what I was doing initially.

Game is modelled after NES and Atari games. It contains many of signatures of games during that period. E.g. the traditional game loop.

Design Patterns

Strategy Pattern - Alter object behaviour at runtime. Decouple class behaviour from the classes themselves.

Simple Factory Pattern - Decouple the object creation process from the Breakout game instance.

Facade pattern - Simplify interactions with the game engine. Reduce dependencies on individual components of the system.

Use of parameter objects - increase scalability. Only have to edit the parameter object and its associated abstract class. Don't have to edit all child classes.
